                                    CALL FOR PROPOSALS
                e-MERLIN is open to proposals from the international
                astronomical community on the basis of scientific
                merit alone. Proposals are competitively peer-reviewed
                under standard STFC rules by the PATT e-MERLIN Time
                allocation Committee. During the first 5 semesters of
                e-MERLIN operations ~50% of observing time has been
                allocated to 11 large legacy projects and most of the
                remaining time will be allocated via PATT to standard
                proposals solicited prior to each observing semester.


                  Semester 12A Observations : February 2012 - July 2012
                   Deadline for Receipt of Proposals - 26th January 2012
    
                                     **************





                             Observing frequencies available:-


				L-Band: 1.23GHz to 1.74GHz

				C-Band:  4.5GHz to 7.5GHz





         * The Lovell Telescope will be available for up to 15 days at
	   L-Band and C-Band for during Semester 12A at the discretion
	   of the University of Manchester. Proposers must make a
	   detailed case for the inclusion of the Lovell telescope in
	   their proposed observations. 

  	 * During Semester 12A e-MERLIN operations will be on a shared-risk
	   basis and no approved programmes are guaranteed time. 

	 * Please note that K-Band will not be available during Semester 12A. 

         * It is envisaged that rapid frequency flexibility between L- and
	   C-Band will not be available during Semester 12A. 
	   
	 * Proposers should consult the allocated e-MERLIN legacy
           programme to avoid conflicts with these observtions (see
           notes below). Observations which replicate portions of
           allocated leagcy projects will not be granted. 


        The system parameters for observation of a continuum source in optimum
	conditions (dry weather conditions and observations above 35 degrees
	in elevation)are:-

                                       L-Band       C-Band     
        Maximum angular resolution     ~ 150        ~ 40        (mas)
        RMS level for 12 hr on source  ~ 12/6**     ~ 13/7**   (uJy/beam)
        Maximum bandwidth/polarization ~ 300        ~ 500        (MHz)

    ****************************************************************************
    *   Proposals should be submitted via the e-MERLIN Web-based Proposal Tool *
    *									       *
    *   The proposal tool will be open for proposal submissions from	       *
    *				       January 1st 2012			       *

        Notes:

        ** The use of the Lovell telescope at L-Band, and at C-Band with
	the new receiver systems reduces the 12 hr. rms noise level by
	~50% compared with the array not including the Lovell Telescope.
	
	Frequency switching: Due to commissioning commitments rapid
	cycling between L- and C-band will not be
	permitted. Moderately rapid frequency changes (within an
	observing run) will be allowed within
	C-band(4.5-7.5GHz). However, proposers should note that such
	changes (e.g. observing band 4.5-5.0GHz and 6.5-7.0GHz) within
	a single observing run (e.g. cycling between bands) whilst
	permited will result in significant additional calibration
	overheads and are hence strongly discouraged.
	
	Nominal sensitivities are based upon a 12-hr on target observation
	(~18-hr equivalent with calibration). All sensitivities are for ideal
	circumstances (source elevation, weather, RFI environment and so forth
	will have a detrimental effect on the actual sensitivity
	achieved). During cycle-0 projected sensitivities are subject to
	changes due to ongoing commissioning activities and cannot be
	guaranteed. 

	Details of available spectral line configurations are
	available at http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/cycle0.html.

	Proposers should take careful note of the observations
	allocated to the e-MERLIN legacy groups (see
	http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/).  
	The e-MERLIN Legacy programmes will run concurrently with PATT
	observations from Semester 12A for up to 5
	semesters. Proposals for observations which form part of
	allocated legacy programmes and compromise the scienctific
	objectives of these programmes will not be allocated by the
	e-MERLIN TAG. All e-MERLIN legacy proposal are available at
	http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/. Proposers requireing
	further information should contact emerlin@jb.man.ac.uk for
	clarification well indavance of proposal submission.  
        
        Access to e-MERLIN for Scientists from EU Countries:
        e-MERLIN is one of the participating institutes in the RadioNet project
        from which transnational access within the EU to existing observing
        facilities is financially supported (RadioNet 3).
