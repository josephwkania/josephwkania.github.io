<center><h1><i>e</i>-MERLIN/VLBI National Facility</h1>
<h1>Trans-National access to <i>e</i>-MERLIN</h1></center>



<p>         Access to <i>e</i>-MERLIN for Scientists from EU Countries:
         <i>e</i>-MERLIN is one of the participating institutes in the RadioNet project
         from which transnational access (TNA) within the EU to existing
        observing facilities is financially supported. TNA support
        envisaged for the RadioNet3 provision from January 1st 2012
        includes travel reimbursement for data reduction visits
        to the <i>e</i>-MERLIN support facility in JBCA Manchester for
        TNA-enabled programmes.</p>

<p>The members of the research team from eligible projects may also receive travel 
subsidies through the EC's RadioNet trans-national access (TNA) program. In the
specific case of the e-MERLIN, "eligible" means in brief that:

<ul>
<li>The PI is from an institute in a country of the EU or Associated States, with the 
exception of the UK. </li>

<li>The same criterion, but applied collectively to 50% or
more of the individual members of the research team.</li>

<li>The research team is defined by the co-authors listed on the observing proposal, and 
the association of researcher with institute remains fixed at that shown on the
proposal.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Requested TNA Acknowledgment</h1>

<p>If you have a MERLIN or e-MERLIN project that is eligible for support via the RadioNet TNA program, would you 
please include the appropriate acknowledgment in papers, conference proceedigs, etc. that result from the 
project:</p>
