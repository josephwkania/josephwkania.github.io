<h1>Observing with e-MERLIN</h1>

<p>e-MERLIN is open to proposals from the international astronomical community on
the basis of scientific merit alone. Proposals are competitively peer-reviewed
under standard <a 
href="http://stfc.ac.uk">STFC</a> rules by the  <a 
href="http://www.scitech.ac.uk/SciProg/Ast/AstDocs/PATT.aspx">PATT</a> e-MERLIN Time allocation Committee.
During the first 5 semesters of e-MERLIN operations ~50% of observing time has
been allocated to 12 large <a href="../legacy/">legacy projects</a> and most of the remaining time will
be allocated via <a
href="http://www.scitech.ac.uk/SciProg/Ast/AstDocs/PATT.aspx">PATT</a> to standard proposals solicited prior to each observing
semester</p>

<h3> Deadline : Midnight (23:59 GMT) 14th June 2013</h3>


<p> The second open round for e-MERLIN proposals is planned for 2013, with observations scheduled for 
September 2013 onwards.</p>

<p>For questions regarding <a href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/cycle1.html">technical capabilities</a> and opportunities for cycle-1 observations

<p>Regular status updates on e-MERLIN developments and capabilities are available
on <a href="http://www.souk.ac.uk">e-MERLIN webpages</a>.

<h3> Proposal process:</h3>

<p>e-MERLIN cycle-1 proposals must be submitted via the <a
href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/northstar.html">e-MERLIN
NorthStar web-based proposals submission tool</a>. To submit an
application for time, go to the <a href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/northstar.html">NorthStar
website</a> (register as a new user if necessary) and follow the
instructions given in the help file that you will find on the welcome page.</p>

<p><b> The proposal tool will be open for proposal submissions from 22th May 2013.</b></p>

<p>Submitted proposals will be subject to peer review via a <a 
href="http://www.scitech.ac.uk/SciProg/Ast/AstDocs/PATT.aspx">PATT</a>
e-MERLIN Time Allocation Committee (Phase 1). Successful proposals
will then be subject to a second pass in which full observing details will be verified
(Phase 2). By default e-MERLIN observations are dynamically scheduled by the
operations team. Following the completion of the scheduled observations, users
are encouraged to visit the e-MERLIN Visitors Suite at the  <a href="http://www.jb.man.ac.uk">Jodrell Bank
Centre for Astrophysics</a> (Alan Turing Building, University of Manchester) where
full face-to-face support is available to assist with all aspects of data
processing.</p>
