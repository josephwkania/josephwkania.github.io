<h1>CALL FOR <i>e</i>-MERLIN PROPOSALS - Cycle-8</h1></center>

<p>

<i>e</i>-MERLIN requests proposals from the international astronomical
community for observations to be made during Cycle-8. Proposals are
competitively peer-reviewed under standard STFC rules by the PATT
e-MERLIN Time Allocation Committee. Allocation will be made on the
basis of scientific merit and technical feasibility alone. During
e-MERLIN operations >50% of observing time has been allocated to large
legacy projects and the remaining formal time will be allocated via
PATT to standard proposals solicited prior to each observing
semester along with additional technical development programmes. </p>

<p>e-MERLIN provides high resolution (12-150mas) and high
sensitivity (~[7]-14 microJy [including Lovell Telescope] in Cycle-8)
imaging at cm wavelengths as well as polarimetry, spectroscopy and
astrometry. Cycle-8 observations will commence in Quarter 2019. </p>


<p> <i>e</i>-MERLIN provides high resolution (12-150mas) and high
  sensitivity (~[7]-14 microJy [inc. Lovell Telescope] in Cycle-8)
  imaging at cm wavelengths as well as polarimetry, spectroscopy and
  astrometry. Cycle-8 observations will commence in Quarter 1 2019.


</p>

<p> <b>During Cycle-8:</b>All proposals
  should be justified assuming the current available bandwidth of
  512MHz. K-Band observations are also offered on a best-efforts
  basis. <br>

          Quarters 1 and 2 - 2019<br>
          Deadline for Receipt of Proposals - 23:59:59 UT on 22nd
          November 2018**</center></b></p>
<i>**Please due to technical issues with the e-MERLIN Northstar proposal tool this is a revised proposal deadline.</i>

                              Observing frequencies available:-<br>


                                L-Band: 1.23GHz to 1.74GHz<br>

                                C-Band:  4.5GHz to 7.5GHz<br>

			      K-Band: 21GHz to 24GHz 

</center>
</p>
<p>
   
<ul> <li>Proposers must make a detailed case for the inclusion of the
    Lovell telescope in their proposed observations.</li>
<li>Proposers should consult the allocated e-MERLIN legacy programme
  to avoid conflicts (see notes below). In cases where PATT proposals
  directly replicate portions of allocated legacy projects, legacy
  projects will normally be given priority. </li>


<li>During Cycle-8 there are two VLBI disc-recording session (Feb 21 -
	Mar 14, & May 18 â€“ June 13, 2019). Simultaneous joint VLBI + e-MERLIN observations are
	offered on a best efforts basis, and every effort will be made
	to provide simultaneous or contemporaneous matching e-MERLIN
	observations for joint programmes. EVN proposals should be
	submitted to the EVN Programme Committee - details for
	proposing for EVN time can be found via
	the <a href="http://www.evlbi.org/">EVN web pages</a>.</li>

<li><b>e-MERLIN User support:</b>  Support is available throughout the full life-cycle (proposal to publication) of projects,  for all users via face-to-face and remote assistance, and online tools. The e-MERLIN science support team are happy to tailor levels of assistance dependent on the requirements of individual users or projects.  
Please contact: emerlin@jb.man.ac.uk.</li>

<p>                   See notes below:</p>

<ul>
<li> *During Cycle-8 e-MERLIN C and K-Band operations utilising
  bandwidths wider than 512MHz will be on a best-efforts basis and no
  programmes are guaranteed. PIs of allocated proposals which may
  benefit from these enhanced capabilities will be informed and given
  the option to use these capabilities as they become available. </li>

<li>The sensitivities quoted are under ideal conditions and assume no
  contribution from confusion or dynamic range limitations. So far,
  from observations of 12-24 hrs duration have reached sensitivities
  within few percent of these nominal values at L-band, with and
  without the Lovell Telescope in optimal observing conditions. </li>

<li>** The use of the Lovell telescope at L-Band, and at C-Band with the new receiver systems, reduces the 12 hr rms noise level in the central part of the field of view by ~50% compared with the array not including the Lovell Telescope.</li>

<li>Frequency switching: Rapid cycling between bands is not yet
  permitted. Within C and K-band, frequency changes on time-scales of
  >2 hour will be possible. However, proposers should note that such
  programmes (e.g. cycling between observing bands 4.5-5.0GHz and
  6.5-7.0GHz within a single observing run) will result in significant
  additional calibration overheads. Proposals with frequency changes
  faster than once every 2hrs will not usually be permitted. </li>

<li>Nominal sensitivities are based upon a 12-hr on target observation
  (~18-hr equivalent with calibration). All quoted sensitivities are
  for ideal conditions. During Cycle-8 projected sensitivities are
  subject to changes due to on-going commissioning activities and
  cannot be guaranteed. </li>

<li>        Details of available spectral line configurations are
        available at <a 
href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/cycle8.html">http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/cycle8.html.</a></li>

<li>      Proposers should take careful note of the observations
        allocated to the <i>e</i>-MERLIN legacy groups (see
        <a href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/">http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/</a>).
        The <i>e</i>-MERLIN Legacy programmes will run concurrently with PATT
        observations. In cases where PATT proposals directly replicate portions of 
        allocated legacy projects, legacy projects will normally be given priority.
        All <i>e</i>-MERLIN legacy proposal are available at
        <a href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/">http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/</a>. Proposers requiring
        further information should contact emerlin@jb.man.ac.uk for
        clarification well in advance of proposal submission.</li>

<li>         Access to <i>e</i>-MERLIN for Scientists:
         <i>e</i>-MERLIN is one of the participating institutes in the
         RadioNet project from which transnational access (TNA) within
         the EU to existing observing facilities is financially
         supported. RadioNet has received funding from the European
         Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under
         grant agreement No 730562 which includes travel reimbursement
         for data reduction visits to the e-MERLIN support facility in
         JBCA Manchester for TNA-enabled programmes. </li>

<li> It is e-MERLIN policy to rollover any incomplete A-graded
  programmes for ONE cycle only. PIs with incomplete allocated
  programmed from Cycle-6 or earlier, or unobserved B-graded
  programmes from Cycle-7 are invited to re-proposes.
