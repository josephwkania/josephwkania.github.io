<center><h1>e-MERLIN/VLBI National Facility</h1>
<h1>CALL FOR e-MERLIN PROPOSALS - Cycle-0 (Semester 2012A)</h1></center>

<p>
e-MERLIN is now open to proposals from the international
astronomical community.  Proposals are competitively peer-reviewed
under standard STFC rules by the PATT e-MERLIN Time
allocation Committee. Allocation will be made on the basis of scientific
merit and technical feasibility alone. During the first 5 semesters of
                 e-MERLIN operations ~50% of observing time has been
                 allocated to 12 large legacy projects and most of the
                 remaining time will be allocated via PATT to standard
                 proposals solicited prior to each observing semester.
</p>

<p>
e-MERLIN provides high resolution (40-150mas) and high 
                sensitivity (~6-12 uJy in this cycle-0) imaging at cm 
                wavelengths as well as polarimetry, spectroscopy and 
                astrometry. Shared-risk 'Cycle-0' observations will start in February
                2012, with some limitations in observing capabilities.
</p>

<p>During semester 12A, some commissioning and development
                work may still take place. Shared risk observations will
                be carried out on a best-effort basis, but essential 
                system work will take priority over PATT observations. 
                The continuum bandwidth at C-band is currently limited
                to 512MHz. The full 2GHz bandwidth will not become
                available until a later semester.</p>


  <p><b><center>        Semester 12A Observations (e-MERLIN Cycle-0) : February - July 2012<br>
          Deadline for Receipt of Proposals - 23:59:59 UT on 26th January 2012</center></b></p>

                              Observing frequencies available:-<br>


                                L-Band: 1.23GHz to 1.74GHz<br>

                                C-Band:  4.5GHz to 7.5GHz
</center>

<p>
   
<ul>
<li>       The Lovell Telescope will be available for up to 15 days at
           L-Band and C-Band for during Semester 12A at the discretion
           of the University of Manchester. Proposers must make a
           detailed case for the inclusion of the Lovell telescope in
           their proposed observations.</li>

<li>          During Semester 12A e-MERLIN operations will be on a shared-risk
           basis and no approved programmes are guaranteed time.</li>

<li>          Please note that K-Band observations and rapid frequency flexibility 
           between L- and C-Band will not be available during Semester 12A.</li>


<li>          Proposers should consult the allocated e-MERLIN legacy
           programme to avoid conflicts (see notes below). In cases 
           where PATT proposals directly replicate portions of 
           allocated legacy projects, legacy projects will normally be 
           given priority.</li>

<li>During Semester 12A there are two VLBI sessions. Joint simultaneous e-MERLIN+EVN
observations are not available in this Semester although associated but separate e-MERLIN
and EVN proposals are of course allowed. EVN proposals should be submitted to the EVN
Programme Committee - details for proposing for EVN time can be found here:
<a href="http://www.evlbi.org/proposals/prop.html">http://www.evlbi.org/proposals/prop.html</a></li>

     Tool.The proposal tool will be open for proposal submissions from
     January 11th 2012<br>

<p>                   See notes below:</p>

<ul>

    <li>     ** The use of the Lovell telescope at L-Band, and at C-Band with
        the new receiver systems reduces the 12 hr rms noise level in the central part of the field of view by
        ~50% compared with the array not including the Lovell Telescope.</li>

<li>        Frequency switching: Due to commissioning commitments in
        Semester 12A, rapid cycling between L- and C-Band will not be
        permitted. Within C-Band, frequency changes on time-scales of
        >2 hr will be possible. However, proposers should note that
        such programmes (e.g. cycling between observing bands 4.5-5.0GHz
        and 6.5-7.0GHz within a single observing run) will result in
        significant additional calibration overheads. Proposals with frequency 
        changes faster than once every 2hrs will not be permitted.</li>

<li>        Nominal sensitivities are based upon a 12-hr on target observation
        (~18-hr equivalent with calibration). All quoted sensitivities are
        for ideal conditions. During Semester 12A  projected sensitivities
        are subject to changes due to ongoing commissioning activities and
        cannot be guaranteed.</li>

<li>        Details of available spectral line configurations are
        available at <a href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/cycle0.html">http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/cycle0.html.</a></li>


<li>      Proposers should take careful note of the observations
        allocated to the e-MERLIN legacy groups (see
        <a href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/">http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/</a>).
        The e-MERLIN Legacy programmes will run concurrently with PATT
        observations from Semester 12A for up to 5
        semesters. In cases where PATT proposals directly replicate portions of 
        allocated legacy projects, legacy projects will normally be given priority.
        All e-MERLIN legacy proposal are available at
        <a href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/">http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/</a>. Proposers requiring
        further information should contact emerlin@jb.man.ac.uk for
        clarification well in advance of proposal submission.</li>

<li>         Access to e-MERLIN for Scientists from EU Countries:
         e-MERLIN is one of the participating institutes in the RadioNet project
         from which transnational access (TNA) within the EU to existing
        observing facilities is financially supported. TNA support
        envisaged for the RadioNet3 provision from January 1st 2012
        includes travel reimbursement for data reduction visits
        to the e-MERLIN support facility in JBCA Manchester for
        TNA-enabled programmes.</li>
