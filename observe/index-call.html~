<h1>Observe</h1>

<p>Like MERLIN, e-MERLIN is a common user instrument and open to proposals from the entire worldwide 
astronomical community. Proposals are competitively peer-reviewed under standard <a 
href="http://stfc.ac.uk">STFC</a> rules by the <a 
href="http://www.scitech.ac.uk/SciProg/Ast/AstDocs/PATT.aspx">PATT</a> e-MERLIN Time allocation 
Committee. During the first 5 semesters of e-MERLIN operations ~50% of observing time has been allocated 
to 11 large <a href="../legacy/">legacy projects</a>, the remaining time will be allocated via 
<a href="http://www.scitech.ac.uk/SciProg/Ast/AstDocs/PATT.aspx">PATT</a> to standard proposals 
solicited 
each prior to each observing semester</p>

<p>The web-based proposal tool NorthStar has been successfully used for
MERLIN and EVN proposals and it will also be
adopted for the initial submission of e-MERLIN proposals. Invitations for
proposals for shared-risk observations within the commissioning period
are now available.  Open PATT time allocations will be made for observations 
from Semester 2012A. <!-- By this time links to the
NorthStar e-MERLIN portal will appear on this page. To submit an
application for time, go to the NorthStar website (register as a new
user if necessary) and follow the instructions given in the help file
that you will find on the welcome page.--> 
</p>

<p> Please consult the <a 
href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/status.html">status</a> regularly 
for updates and revisions of the e-MERLIN delivery timeline.<p/>


<p> Invitations for proposals will be distributed twice per year and
submitted proposals will be subject to peer review via a <a 
href="http://www.scitech.ac.uk/SciProg/Ast/AstDocs/PATT.aspx">PATT</a> 
e-MERLIN
Time Allocation Committee (Phase 1). Successful proposals will then be
subject to a second pass in which full observing details will be
verified (Phase 2).  By default e-MERLIN observations are dynamically
scheduled by the operations team. Following the completion of the
scheduled observations, the user is invited to attend the e-MERLIN
Visitors Suite housed in the <a 
href="http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk">Jodrell Bank Centre for 
Astrophysics</a>
where full face-to-face support is available to assist the user in the
processing of their data to final astronomical images.</p>
