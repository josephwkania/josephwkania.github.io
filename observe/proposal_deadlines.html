<h3> e-MERLIN Proposal submission process:</h3>

<p>e-MERLIN proposals must be submitted via the <a
href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/northstar.html">e-MERLIN
NorthStar web-based proposals submission tool</a>. To submit an
application for time, go to the <a href="http://www.emerlin.ac.uk/observe/northstar.html">NorthStar
website</a> (register as a new user if necessary) and follow the instructions given in the help file that you will find on the welcome
page.</p>




<p> Invitations for proposals will be distributed twice per year and
submitted proposals will be subject to peer review via a <a 
href="http://www.stfc.ac.uk/about-us/how-we-are-governed/advisory-boards-panels-committees/panel-for-the-allocation-of-telescope-time/">STFC PATT</a> 
e-MERLIN
Time Allocation Committee (Phase 1). Successful proposals will then be
subject to a second pass in which full observing details will be
verified (Phase 2).  By default e-MERLIN observations are dynamically
scheduled by the operations team. Following the completion of the
scheduled observations, the user is invited to attend the e-MERLIN
Visitors Suite housed in the <a 
href="http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk">Jodrell Bank Centre for 
Astrophysics</a>
where full face-to-face support is available to assist the user in the
processing of their data to final astronomical images.</p>
