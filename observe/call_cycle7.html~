<center><h1><i>e</i>-MERLIN/VLBI National Facility</h1>
<h1>CALL FOR <i>e</i>-MERLIN PROPOSALS - Cycle-6</h1></center>

<p>

<i>e</i>-MERLIN requests proposals from the international astronomical community for observations to be made during Cycle-6. Proposals are competitively 
peer-reviewed under standard STFC rules by the PATT e-MERLIN Time Allocation Committee. Allocation will be made on the basis of scientific merit and 
technical feasibility alone. During e-MERLIN operations ~50% of observing time has been allocated to large legacy projects and most of the remaining 
time will be allocated via PATT to standard proposals solicited prior to each observing semester. </p>

<p> <i>e</i>-MERLIN provides high resolution (12-150mas) and high sensitivity (~[7]-14 microJy [inc. Lovell Telescope] in Cycle-6) imaging at cm 
wavelengths as well as polarimetry, spectroscopy and
  astrometry. Cycle-6 observations will commence in December 2017.

</p>

<p> <b>Developments during Cycle-6:</b>Following testing and commissioning, the introduction of the full 2GHz bandwidth at C and K-Band is scheduled for 
delivery during the Cycle-6 observing period*. PATT observations made after this development may benefit from this extra bandwidth once it becomes 
available, however, this will be offered initially on a shared-risk basis. All proposals should be justified assuming the current available bandwidth of 
512MHz. K-Band observations are also offered on a best-efforts basis. New C- and K-Band receivers with improved sensitivity are being installed during Cycle 6.  <br>



  <p><b><center>        Cycle-6 <i>e</i>-MERLIN Observations : December 2017 - May 2018<br>
          Deadline for Receipt of Proposals - 23:59:59 UT on 16th
          November 2017</center></b></p>

                              Observing frequencies available:-<br>


                                L-Band: 1.23GHz to 1.74GHz<br>

                                C-Band:  4.5GHz to 7.5GHz<br>

			      K-Band: 21GHz to 24GHz

<ul> <li> The University of Manchester is undertaking a 15 Million pounds upgrade programme on the JBO site including major 
work on the Lovell Telescope. As such during this e-MERLIN cycle there will be a limited availability of up to 8 days of the Lovell telescope for the 
inclusion within e-MERLIN PATT observations at L and C-band. Proposers must make a detailed case for the inclusion of the Lovell telescope in their 
proposed observations. </li> 

<li>*During Cycle-6 e-MERLIN C and K-Band operations utilising bandwidths wider than 512MHz will be on a best-efforts 
basis and no programmes are guaranteed.  PIs of allocated proposals
  which may benefit from  these enhanced capabilities will be informed and given the option to use these capabilities when they become available. </li>


<li>Proposers should consult the allocated e-MERLIN legacy programme to avoid
conflicts (see notes below). In cases where PATT proposals directly replicate portions
of allocated legacy projects, legacy projects will normally be given priority.
</li>

	<li>During Cycle-6 there are two VLBI disc-recording session
	  (Feb 22 - Mar 15, & May 24 - Jun 14 2018). Simultaneous
	  joint VLBI+e-MERLIN observations are offered on a best
	  efforts basis, and every effort will be made to provide
	  simultaneous or contemporaneous matching  e-MERLIN
	  observations for joint programmes. EVN proposals should be
	  submitted to the EVN Programme Committee - details for proposing for EVN time can be  found via the <a href="http://www.evlbi.org/">EVN web pages</a>.</li>

<p> Proposals should be submitted via the <i>e</i>-MERLIN Web-based Northstar Proposal
     Tool. The proposal tool will be open for proposal submissions
     from 19th October 2017.<br>

<p>                   See notes below:</p>

<ul>
<li> The sensitivities quoted are under ideal conditions and assume no
  contribution from confusion or dynamic range limitations. So far,
  from observations of 12-24 hrs duration have reached sensitivities
  within few percent of these nominal values at L-band, with and
  without the Lovell Telescope in optiml observing conditions. </li>

<li>     ** The use of the Lovell telescope at L-Band, and at C-Band
        with the new receiver systems, reduces the 12 hr rms noise
        level in the central part of the field of view by
        ~50% compared with the array not including the Lovell
        Telescope.</li>


<li> Frequency switching: Rapid cycling between bands is not yet permitted. Within C and K-band, frequency changes on time-scales of >2 hour will be 
possible. However, proposers should note that such programmes (e.g. cycling between observing bands 4.5-5.0GHz and 6.5-7.0GHz within a single observing 
run) will result in significant additional calibration overheads. Proposals with frequency changes faster than once every 2hrs will not be permitted.</li>

<li>Nominal sensitivities are based upon a 12-hr on target observation (~18-hr equivalent
with calibration). All quoted sensitivities are for ideal conditions. During cycle-6
projected sensitivities are subject to changes due to on-going commissioning activities
and cannot be guaranteed.
</li>

<li>        Details of available spectral line configurations are
        available at <a 
href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/cycle6.html">http://www.souk.ac.uk/observe/cycle6.html.</a></li>

<li>      Proposers should take careful note of the observations
        allocated to the <i>e</i>-MERLIN legacy groups (see
        <a href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/">http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/</a>).
        The <i>e</i>-MERLIN Legacy programmes will run concurrently with PATT
        observations. In cases where PATT proposals directly replicate portions of 
        allocated legacy projects, legacy projects will normally be given priority.
        All <i>e</i>-MERLIN legacy proposal are available at
        <a href="http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/">http://www.souk.ac.uk/legacy/</a>. Proposers requiring
        further information should contact emerlin@jb.man.ac.uk for
        clarification well in advance of proposal submission.</li>

<li>         Access to <i>e</i>-MERLIN for Scientists:
         <i>e</i>-MERLIN is one of the participating institutes in the RadioNet project from which transnational access (TNA) within the EU to existing 
observing facilities is financially supported. RadioNet has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 
under grant agreement No 730562 which includes travel reimbursement for data reduction visits to the e-MERLIN support facility in JBCA Manchester for 
TNA-enabled programmes. </li>
