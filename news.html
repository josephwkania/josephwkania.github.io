As time goes by, dual SMBHs would get closer to each other due to dynamical friction, form binary SMBHs with a compact orbit and finally coalesce. Searching for close (∼kpc or sub-kpc) dual SMBHs, the progenitors of coalescing SMBHs, thus are essential to probe their dynamical evolution as well as the process of galaxy merging, especially at high redshifts when galaxy mergers occur much more frequently. Such dual SMBHs may appear as a dual AGN (active galactic nuclei) if both SMBHs are accreting, or an off-nucleus AGN, if only one SMBH is active. However dual and off-nucleus AGN were previously found mostly at low redshifts or large separations (> 10 kpc). 


                                                                        <a class="image featured"><img src="./Wang_Varstrometry1.png " title="The radio-optical offsets of five candidates of dual-SMBHs (blue vertical lines) and the control sample of normal quasars (red histogram).

                                                                        <p>

These candidate quasars (luminous AGN) were pre-selected with clear astrometric jitters in Gaia EDR3, as the stochastic flux variabilities of the dual or off-nucleus quasar could yield astrometric variation of the photocenter of the dual-SMBH system. e-MERLIN observations revealed a single compact radio source for each candidate. Remarkably, four of them exhibit significant radio-optical offsets, which represent for the anticipated separations between one radio loud nucleus and the optical photocenter of a dual-SMBH system. Such radio-optical offsets are hardly seen in normal quasars, thus strongly favor the scenario of dual or off-nucleus quasars. The team confirms the projected separations of the candidate dual SMBHs could be as small as sub-kpc, and highlights the unique capability of high-resolution radio images to investigate close dual SMBHs.

In radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), it is especially important as the radio emission can be due to the presence of a radio jets from an accreting AGN, winds, star formation, coronae, or a combination of the above. In lower-resolution studies, it is hard to disentangle these processes, but at sub-arcsecond resolution, a high-brightness temperature core can be attributed to the presence of jets or coronae from an accreting AGN, rather than star formation or winds. The spectral index, morphology and flux densities of the source also give clues to the source of the emission too. By combining the information from multiple arrays, it is possible to get a statistical understanding of the contribution of these different processes to the observed radio emission.

In 10/16 RQQ cases, radio emission was unequivocally detected in the VLBA data, with 8 of those exhibiting a compact core. They noticed a division in the RLQs and the RQQs at ~30mJy, with RQQs likely due a combination of star formation and AGN activity. Moreover, the RQQs in their study proved to be highly resolved, due to extended jets or relic emission. One source, PG 0050+124, which was observed with EVN+e-MERLIN demonstrates this well. The combination of longer exposure time, and use of intermediate and long baselines from the e-MERLIN/EVN antennas enabled a noise level of 9µJy/beam, about 2.5 times lower than the noise in the VLBA image at a comparable frequency. Thanks to its impressive sensitivity, the EVN+eMERLIN image of PG 0050+124 unveils a more intricate jet structure.

The relationship between the mass of the bulge and the mass of the central accreting supermassive black hole powering the AGN is firmly established, with the two growing together. For nearby galaxies, distinguishing between the AGN and the bulge is possible due to the AGN's much higher central surface brightness in the optical, but this is not true for low-luminosity AGN. Furthermore, other nuclear features, e.g., rings and bars can complicate matters, but using high resolution e-MERLIN radio data and Hubble optical data, it is possible to discriminate the AGN from other sources of emission. The resolution of Hubble is comparable to that of e-MERLIN at 1.5 GHz, making the two a perfect synergetic pair for exploring the effect that bulge properties have on AGN, which is one of the goals of the LeMMINGs survey.

As part of this project, the LeMMINGs team has recently published 1.5 GHz e-MERLIN radio data for the full sample of 280 nearby galaxies. In a subsequent study, the team used data from the Hubble Science Archive and performed multi-component decompositions of optical images for 173 out of 280 galaxies and quantify the impact of various galaxy components (bulge, disc, AGN, bar, ring, spiral arms, and star clusters) on the optical galaxy profile. This allowed them to accurately measure optical bulge properties. In this work, Bil Dullo and the LeMMINGs team investigated the link between the radio core luminosity and the properties of the host bulge as well as its surrounding  environment. When compared to the radio data, bulge dominance is linked to brighter radio core luminosities, with the both AGN and radio detection fractions increasing with the bulge mass. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a transition from AGN-dominated radio emission in massive bulges to stellar-driven processes in low-mass bulges. Radio-loud hosts preferred early-type morphology, but no obvious dependence on environment was found for radio loudness, nuclear radio activity, and the AGN fraction at a fixed bulge mass. Radio-loud and radio-quiet hosts are indistinguishable in terms of the Sersic index and ellipticity of the bulge.

The purpose of this school is to show participants how to reduce e-MERLIN data using the e-MERLIN CASA Pipeline. The school is designed for those with some radio astronomy knowledge. Priority will be given to PhD students and early career researchers. The three-day school will include calibration, imaging and self-calibration tutorials, with an opportunity to bring your own data (BYOD) to get expert help with your own e-MERLIN projects. We expect to be able to have space for up to 10 participants.

										<h2><a>Setting up for SETI with e-MERLIN</a></h2>
										<br><h3>June 2023</h3><br>
										
										<p>Searching for SETI calibrator sources resulted in a neutral hydrogen detection but no technosignatures. </p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									Over the course of the last decade, the Breakthrough Listen project has reinvigorated the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) to buy telescope time and develop new tools and techniques. Until recently, large single dishes have been used e.g. the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) as well as beam-forming arrays e.g. the MeerKAT that forms pencil-shaped beams for targeted searches over a small area of the sky. The use of arrays with long baselines like the European VLBI Network (EVN) has not been fully explored despite the advantages such arrays offer over the other instruments. VLBI arrays are more robust to radio frequency interference since RFI must be present in a baseline to correlate. The increased sensitivity increases the robustness of the detection and VLBI has a high astrometric accuracy which could aid in the localisation of technosignatures in the solar system. 

									<a class="image featured"><img src="./wandia.png " title="Hydrogen line detection, from Wandia et al., 2023" alt="" /></a>

								

									<p>
									University of Manchester Phd student Kelvin Wandia and collaborators set up a VLBI experiment to search for secondary calibrator sources for future SETI surveys in the Kepler fields, which include Kepler-111b, an exoplanet orbiting a G-type star. While no secondary calibrators were found, a nearby primary calibrator, J1926+4441 was correlated at high temporal and spectral resolution in order to search for SETI-like signals. During the data analysis, a feature at 1420.4 MHz was found, though further follow-up observations with the EVN and e-MERLIN revealed that the feature was due to the rise in the system temperatures due to galactic hydrogen filling the beams of the antennas. However, this still demonstrated a new data analysis/interpretation scheme for SETI using VLBI. After flagging this feature from the data, it was possible to search for technosignatures from Kepler-111b, though no transmitters were detected.

										<h2><a>The first radio detection of a Type 1a supernova, thanks to e-MERLIN</a></h2>
										<br><h3>May 2023</h3><br>
										
										<p>SN2020eyj was detected in the radio using e-MERLIN, over 500 days after the initial optical discovery </p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									Supernovae are the result of the deaths of stars - a large explosion rips the star apart. They are responsible for some of the heavier elements we find in the Universe. One of the best studied types of supernova are the Type 1a, which is caused by a white dwarf accreting too much mass and exploding. Because Type 1a supernovae reach the same critical mass before exploding, they have been used for years as standardisable candles in cosmology. However, two competing mechanisms have been argued to be the progenitor systems of Type 1as, either the merger of two white dwarfs, or, one white dwarf accretes mass from a companion normal star. Detecting radio emission from a Type 1a supernova has long been sought after, as it is expected in the case of accretion from a companion star, but not if two white dwarfs merge.

									<a class="image featured"><img src="./type1asnecsm.png " title="Radio light curve plotted against various wind, shell and ISM models, from Kool et al., 2023" alt="" /></a>

									<p>
									The Type 1a supernova SN 2020eyj exploded in March 2020 and was followed by the optical community. It was realised from late-time optical spectra that SN 2020eyj was a sub-type of Type 1a supernova which showed signs of circumstellar medium interaction and was re-classified as a Type 1a-CSM supernova. Following this discovery, requests were made to e-MERLIN to observe this potentially interesting source, over 500 days from its initial discovery.

									<p>
									e-MERLIN's unique combination of sub-arcsecond resolution and micro Jansky sensitivity enabled the detection of SN 2020eyj, the first ever for any Type 1a supernova. The detection of the radio emission in this source effectively rules out the white dwarf merger scenario for SN 2020eyj. This discovery of late-time radio emission from a Type 1a supernova will guide and shape future studies with the next generation of instruments like the Square Kilometre Array.

										<h2><a>LeMMINGs V: linking Hubble with e-MERLIN to explore AGN and galaxy evolution</a></h2>
										<br><h3>April 2023</h3><br>
										
										<p>Hubble and e-MERLIN prove a matching synergistic pair linking AGN and galaxy evolution in the LeMMINGs survey</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									The growth and evolution of galaxies is moderated and shaped by the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the center and star formation in the bulge. The relationship between the mass of the bulge and the central accreting super-massive black hole powering the AGN is well established, with the two growing together. In nearby galaxies it is possible to distinguish the AGN from the bulge as it is usually much brighter in the optical, but this isn't the case for the lowest-luminosity AGN. In addition, other nuclear features like rings and bars can complicate matters, but using high resolution e-MERLIN radio data and Hubble optical data, it is possible to discriminate the AGN from other sources of emission. The resolution of Hubble is comparable to that of e-MERLIN at 1.5 GHz, making the two a perfect match for exploring the effect the AGN has on the bulge and galaxy as a whole, which is one of the goals of the LeMMINGs survey.


									<a class="image featured"><img src="./lemmingsV.png " title="Example of the optical decomposition of the galaxy NGC 2859, from Figure 6 of Dullo et al. 2023." alt="" /></a>

									<p>
									The LeMMINGs is an e-MERLIN legacy project to survey 280 nearby galaxies at 1.5 and 5 GHz at milli-arcsecond resolution to isolate the nuclear emission to find low-luminosity AGN and detect supernova remnant shells which can trace star formation. The 1.5 GHz radio survey of the nuclear regions has already been published. In this work, Bil Dullo and the LeMMINGs team analysed data from the Hubble science archive finding data for 173/280 LeMMINGs galaxies. They performed multi-component decompositions of the optical images to measure the influence of the galaxy bulge, disc, AGN, bar, ring, spiral arms, and nuclear star clusters on the overall galaxy profile. This allowed them to accurately understand the contribution from the bulge to the optical galaxy profile, showing that the bulge becomes rounder, more prominent and larger the further along the Hubble sequence from irregulars to elliptical galaxies. When comparing to the radio information, bulge dominance is also linked to brighter radio core luminosities, with the detection fraction of the radio core increasing with the bulge mass too. A follow up work will look more closely at the radio core luminosity and host bulge properties.

										<h2><a>Finding mini jets in the mini-halo of RXJ1720.1+2638</a></h2>
										<br><h3>March 2023</h3><br>
										
										<p>The discovery of sub-kpc-scale jets in RXJ1720.1+2638 complicates the picture of how the diffuse radio emission is produced in this galaxy cluster.</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									Radio mini-halos are diffuse synchrotron emission found in the centres of some galaxy clusters. They are thought to arise from either aged relativistic electrons being re-accelerated to energies high enough to cause the synchrotron emission, or by relativistic protons interacting with thermal intra-cluster-medium electrons, producing relativistic electrons as part of a decay chain.  In the case of RXJ1720.1+2638, there is competing evidence as to which one dominates. Complicating matters is the presence of an active central nucleus which can also cause energy injection into the system.


									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Perrott_figure.jpeg " title="e-MERLIN observations showing the mini-jet found at the center of RXJ1720.1+2638 from Figure 1 of Perrott et al. 2023." alt="" /></a>

									<p>
									Using e-MERLIN Yvette Perrott and her team were able to show unequivocally that RXJ1720.1+2638 has sub-kpc-scale radio jets. The e-MERLIN data recover ~60% of the total flux of the central core when compared to lower resolution studies, indicating that the jet may extend out further. These data have further implications for correlations of the mini-halo luminosity and the brightest central galaxy luminosity.

										<h2><a>Resolving the extra-galactic population of AGN from star formation with e-MERLIN and EVN</a></h2>
										<br><h3>March 2023</h3><br>
										
										<p>Studies of the Northern SPARCS field at milli-arcsecond resolution have isolated compact AGN emission from star formation for the first time.</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									The SKA PAthfinder Radio Continuum Surveys (SPARCS) are a set of astronomical fields that SKA pathfinder telescopes are observing to make sensitive large-area reference surveys in order to decouple star formation (SF) from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in distant galaxies. Such large and deep surveys will enable the study of galaxy evolution and cosmology and will also determine the key science questions that the SKA will answer.



									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Njeri_figure.jpeg " title="e-MERLIN observations of the Northern SPARCS field from N'jeri et al. 2023." alt="" /></a>

									<p>
									By using e-MERLIN and the EVN together as one instrument, Ann Njeri and her team observed the Northern SPARCS field with a multi-resolution (10-100 milliarcseconds) programme to resolve the compact emission of AGN from the diffuse star formation emission. The combined use of e-MERLIN with the EVN provides the sensitivity to detect the faintest emission, while the resolution detects compact high brightness temperature emission. Using these high spatial resolution (9 pc – 0.3 kpc at 𝑧 ∼ 1.25) data, 11 sources were detected from a targeted sample of 52 known radio sources from previous observations with the eMERLIN, giving a VLBI detection fraction of ∼ 21%. Isolating these high brightness temperature and compact sources improves the ability to isolate the AGN emission from star formation and hence reduce the uncertainties in star formation estimates using the radio band alone.

									<p>
									This SKA-2 like study is the first of its kind for any of the SPARCS reference fields, providing a high spatial dynamic range view (10–100mas) of the high redshift radio source population. These results will inform future SKA observations, in relation to survey/instrument biases, de-coupling AGN and star-formation and addressing key technical verification challenges for SKA pathfinders (and VLBI) such as data processing and source flux density scaling.

										<h2><a>e-MERLIN witnesses power of SMBHs during rare tidal disruption event</a></h2>
										<br><h3>February 2023</h3><br>
										
										<p>e-MERLIN has been involved in a multi-facility campaign to study the jet launched by a supermassive black hole after a wandering star passed too close and was ripped apart.</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									These events are known as jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) and are rather rare: this is the fourth jetted TDE found to date. Since February 2022, observations have been made of the TDE AT2022cmc to understand the long term behaviour of this rare event. The e-MERLIN and multi-facility campaign is designed to understand both the jet and its surrounding environment as it propagates out through the host galaxy.

									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/TDE-launched-jet-NRAO-artist.jpg " title="Artist's impression of a tidal disruption event (credit: NRAO)" alt="" /></a>

									<p>
									In a paper published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Lauren Rhodes (Oxford) and her team demonstrate the importance of high cadence monitoring for studying the evolving radio counterpart. In AT2022cmc, they find evidence of Doppler boosting, where the observed radiation is boosted as a result of the material moving at relativistic velocities. The observations show that the jet is pointed directly at Earth. The highly relativistic velocities of jets such as that associated with AT2022cmc, means that observers are only able to see those pointed at Earth, and therefore are rarely given such a perfect opportunity to study the jet over the coming years as it decelerates and interacts with the environment of their host galaxy.

										<h2><a>LeMMINGs : the e-MERLIN view on super-massive black holes in our Galactic back yard</a></h2>
										<br><h3>December 2021</h3><br>
										
										<p>The Legacy e-MERLIN programme studying nearby galaxy star formation and super-massive black holes has it's third data release.</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									All massive galaxies in the Universe host supermassive black holes in their centres, with masses equivalent from million to billion times the mass of the Sun. Some of these black holes gorge on the gas and dust surrounding them at frenetic rates, giving rise to extraordinary physical phenomena including powerful radio jets. However, the vast majority of supermassive black holes are much less ravenous, accreting at rather low rates. The moderate activity of these black holes produces faint emission, which make them hard to find and isolate. Thanks to the recent large-area and deep surveys with new-generation facilities the astronomers are starting to detect this population of low-power active black holes, mostly in the local Universe.
									<p>
									LeMMINGs, one of e-MERLIN’s legacy programmes is probing this population of low-power active galaxies to produce the deepest high angular resolution view of the local Universe in the radio band. The new study, based on this survey and led by Ranieri Diego Baldi, researcher at the Institute of Radio Astronomy (INAF-IRA) in Bologna (Italy), has provided a better understanding of the connection between several physical mechanisms of radio emission and the black-hole accretion mode at the centre of these galaxies. 
									
									
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/m82.jpg " title="e-MERLIN deep L-band imaging combined with VLA data from Muxlow et al. 2010, showing all of the star forming regions in M82." alt="" /></a>									
									<p>
									“This survey has unveiled radio nuclei at the centre in around half of our sample of local galaxies, which were previously classified as active or inactive based mostly on optical data” Baldi explains. “For the first time, thanks to the combination of high-resolution radio data from our survey and archival optical data, we could provide more robust diagnostics to separate stellar and black hole-driven radio nuclei and break the degeneracy among all the possible radio-emitting physical processes. The radio-band maps from this survey have angular resolution of 0.2 arcsecond, equivalent to a ten millionth of the lunar diameter. This high resolution enabled us to detect radio emission on very small scales (a few hundreds of light years), offering direct views of black-hole accretion even in dusty environments, and detecting active black hole at accretion rates below those detectable in other wave-bands.”
									<p>
									The large survey size of a wide range of different types of galaxy allowed the team to discover the radio signatures of supermassive black holes and ascertain how powerful they are. Baldi added “We found that galaxies powered by weak accretion discs can launch fast or slow jets. Seyfert galaxies, which are generally classified as radio silent but can instead launch bright radio outflows. Star forming galaxies may also host weakly active black holes able to emanate small radio jets”. These results are only the start of the LeMMINGs project, with further observations expected to produce more results in the coming years. Furthermore, these results represent the springboard for future deeper studies with up-coming facilities, such as SKAO.

										<h2><a>e-MERLIN detects a jet corresponding to the shortest ever Gamma-ray burst from a collapsing massive star. </a></h2>
										<br><h3>November 2021</h3><br>
										
										<p>Searches for the radio emission for neutron star mergers have turned up an imposter in the form of a long gamma ray burst.</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									Since 2019, a group of researchers led by Lauren Rhodes, Oxford/MPIfR, have been using e-MERLIN to search for jets launched during binary neutron star mergers which produce short gamma ray bursts (GRBs), like that observed from GW 170817 from 100s of days post-burst, with the aim of better  understanding these rare events. In August and September 2020, a series of e-MERLIN observations were made at the position of GRB 200826A, a new GRB, believing that it originated from a binary neutron star merger. Analysis of the resulting data indicated the presence of a radio jet passing through a stellar wind-like environment.

									<p>
									Evidence of a stellar wind disagrees with theories for binary neutron star evolutionary models, as any stellar material should have left the immediate vicinity of the merger over the billions of years that it takes for the two neutron stars to in-spiral and coalesce. The observations with e-MERLIN show that the jet was propagating though recently ejected material. Such results are more consistent with those from long GRBs, which are produced when a massive star collapses. The group concluded that the jet was most likely launched when a massive star collapsed rather than during the merger of two neutron stars. The GRB itself was misleading in its short duration as shown by subsequent work on this source.

										<h2><a>Launch of Europe's Largest Astronomy Network: ORP</a></h2>
										<br><h3>March 2021</h3><br>

										<p>Launched with funding of €15M under the Horizon 2020 programme, the Opticon Radionet Pilot programme (ORP) aims to harmonise observational methods and tools and provide access to a wider range of both optical and radio astronomy facilities. The CNRS (the French National Centre for Scientific Research) will coordinate the project, together with the University of Cambridge and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. </p>
										<p>e-MERLIN's own Simon Garrington and Rob Beswick will be looking after the ambitious transnational access project, including the development of tools that will harmonise how astronomers gain access to telescopes across Europe. The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics will also be helping develop a strategic plan with the goal of realising a new relationship between the European Commission, major funding agencies and national observatories.</p>
										<p>The ORP will foster the development of 'multi-messenger astronomy' - the use of multiple wavelengths, gravitational waves, cosmic rays and neutrinos, to provide more complete spectral energy observations of objects.  
										<p>Over the next 5 years, the ORP will provide scientists with access to a wide range of instruments, promote training for young astronomers, and open the way to new discoveries.

										<h2><a>Coordinated e-MERLIN, MeerKAT and VLA observations shed new light on black hole ejections</a></h2>
										<br><h3>March 2020</h3><br>
										
										<p>A black hole, ejecting material at close to the speed of light, has been observed using e-MERLIN.</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									A research team based at Oxford University used e-MERLIN, as well as the VLA and MeerKAT based in the US and South Africa, tracked the ejecting material over a period of months. The observations have allowed a deeper understanding into how black holes feed energy into their environment. Co-lead of the project, and author on the paper appearing in Nature Astronomy, Rob Fender said "We've been studying these kind of jets for over 20 years and never have we tracked them so beautifully over such a large distance.”
									
									
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/maxi2.png " title="The evolution of the ejected material from the black-hole over 150 days." alt="" /></a>									
									<p>
									The group successfully tracked these ejections of this particular system, known as MAXI J1820+070, after it went into outburst in the summer of 2018. The extreme distances from the black hole and the final angular separation is among the largest seen from such systems. The ejections are moving so fast that they appear to be moving faster than the speed of light – they are not, rather this is a phenomenon known as apparent superluminal motion. 
									Using our radio observations we were able to better estimate how much energy is contained in these ejections using a novel method for this type of system.’ explains Joe Bright, DPhil student at Oxford University’s Department of Physics. ‘Galactic black holes, such as MAXI J1820+070, are thought to be miniature versions of the supermassive black holes that are found at the centre of galaxies. The feedback from these black holes is thought to be a vital component regulating the growth of galaxies’. 
									<p>Dr Rob Beswick, Head of e-MERLIN science operations at Jodrell Bank stated ‘this work shows the power of world-class instruments such as e-MERLIN, MeerKAT and the VLA working in tandem’ and added ‘e-MERLIN’s unique combination of resolution, sensitivity and rapid response made it the perfect instrument for this sort of study’.

										<h2><a>Early EVN + e-MERLIN observation reveals newborn magnetar.</a></h2>
										<br><h3>January 2020</h3><br>
										<p></p>
										<p>Among short-lived sky phenomena, AT2018cow (The Cow) is an astronomical event like no other. 
											First detected in 2018, it received its memorable name by chance according to alphabetical protocol to classify such events.
											However, it was not just its name that makes it memorable. 
											AT2018cow was identified in a relatively nearby galaxy (about 200 million light years away). 
											Its proximity, exceptionally brief brightness and unusually high temperature led to widespread attention upon discovery. 
										</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									In the current study, an international team led by Prashanth Mohan, astronomer at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, conducted five observations over the course of a year, using a total of 21 telescopes
									 from the European VLBI Network (EVN), which for the first time included live data from e-MERLIN telescopes. Although now a regular occurance, streaming live data over fibre from e-MERLIN's telescope array directly into the EVN was 
									an innovation made possible only a few years ago. 
									As well as adding sensitivity, e-MERLIN's valuable shorter baselines add to the EVN's virtual aperture coverage, increasing sensitivity to spatially extended astronomical features.
									The high-resolution radio imaging provided by these observations led the team to a surprising conclusion: there is no sign of a relativistic jet, an expected feature if the core was powered by a central engine.</p>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/cow.jpg " title="Artist's impression of the magnetar. Credit: Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, China." alt="" /></a>									
									
									<p>
									“These most detailed images in the radio regime do not show any relativistic motion or expansion during this time period. That argues against a jet in the Cow, at least later in its evolution.
									Instead it seems that the Cow was intrinsically bright and originated from a star exploding as a supernova”, says Jun Yang, astronomer at Onsala Space Observatory, Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden
									Such characteristics point to another intriguing possibility, the scientists suggest. Interaction of a magnetar with its strongly magnetized environment around it might also produce short enigmatic phenomena known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). 
									<br>"The EVN is the most sensitive standalone VLBI network in the world that has delivered cutting edge results in the field of transient science. It has by now provided the most accurate localizations of two FRBs.
									There is an intriguing possibility that there may be a link between FRBs and other type of transient sources (like the event that produced 2018ATcow), but this requires further studies", concludes Zsolt Paragi from the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC (JIVE).

										<h2><a>A repeating Fast Radio Burst from a spiral galaxy deepens the mystery of their origin.</a></h2>
										<br><h3>January 2020</h3><br>
										<p></p>
										<p> 
										</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									One of the greatest mysteries in present day astronomy is Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs); short, dramatic bursts of
radio-light seen across the Universe. Although
FRBs last for only a thousandth of a second, there are now hundreds of records of these enigmatic
sources. However, the precise location is known for just four sources.
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/frb_evn.jpeg " title="Impression of the FRB host dwarf galaxy and signal burst." alt="" /></a>									
									
									<p>
									On 19th June 2019, eight telescopes from the European VLBI Network (EVN) including Jodrell Bank (Mark II), simultaneously observed a radio source known as FRB 180916.J0158+65.
									It was originally discovered in 2018 by the CHIME telescope in Canada, which enabled the team, led by Benito Marcote from the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC (JIVE), to conduct the very high resolution observation using the EVN.

									With this knowledge of the location the team were able to conduct observations with one of the world’s largest optical telescopes: the 8 metre Gemini North on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. 
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/B6il324g.png " title="Image of the host dwarf-galaxy taken by the Gemini North 8 metre telescope." alt="" /></a>

Examining the environment around the source revealed that the bursts originated from a spiral galaxy (named SDSS J015800.28+654253.0), located half a billion light years from Earth, specifically from a region of that galaxy where star-formation is prominent.
									
“The found location is radically different from the
previously located repeating FRB, but also different
from all previously studied FRBs.” Explains Kenzie Nimmo, PhD student at the University of
Amsterdam. “The differences between repeating and non
-
repeating fast radio bursts are thus less
clear and we think that these events may not be linked to a particular type of galaxy or environment.

										<h2><a>Astronomers observe the ‘smoking gun’ of an orphan gamma-ray burst afterglow.</a></h2>
										<br><h3>June 2019</h3><br>
										<p></p>
										<p>Gamma-ray bursts are brief, intense flashes of gamma-rays that are difficult to detect. They are believed to be linked to cataclysmic events such as the collapse of a massive star, or the collision and merger of two neutron stars. Evidence of an ‘orphan’ gamma-ray burst afterglow provides astronomers with more possibilities to study, and ultimately understand, such phenomena. 
										</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									When the biggest stars in the Universe reach the end of their lives, they collapse due to their own gravity and produce explosions known as supernovae. In some cases, they also emit a gamma-ray burst, which contains a huge amount of energy: a flash of a few seconds can hold as much energy as the Sun would produce during its entire life. This makes these events detectable across very long distances.</p>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Orphan-GRB-Repeat.gif " title="Artist's animation of the orphan gamma-ray burst afterglow (massive star, explosion, gamma-ray burst, travelling jet bullet, expanding afterglow). Credit: Katharina Immer (JIVE)" alt="" /></a>									
									
									<p>
									After discovering the object in 2018 a team of astronomers led by Benito Marcote (JIVE) conducted a fast response observation (known as a Target of Opportunity) to look at the emission in real time. They used the astronomy technique Very Long Baseline Interferometry to combine radio astronomy antennas from the European VLBI Network (including Europe, Asia and Africa) and the e-MERLIN array.  The team studied the object in detail at a high resolution – equating to being able to read a newspaper from a distance of 40 km. 
At this level of detail the team were able to measure the size of the object. They noted that it corresponded to a cloud with a size of five light years across, which was ejected after the original explosion and that has been traveling all this time (around 30 years) at an average of 10% the speed of light. Such speeds could only have been produced by an extreme explosion, like those seen during gamma-ray bursts. 

“If the jet were pointing towards the Earth, this would have been seen as an extremely bright and powerful gamma-ray burst.” explained Om Salafia, from the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), Italy. “No such burst has been observed at the time of the explosion, but this is not unexpected: the probability that the jet was pointing towards the Earth is very low. For these reasons, we believe that this afterglow is actually orphan”.

FIRST J1419+3940 is thus the first strong evidence that astronomers have of an orphan gamma-ray burst afterglow.
Future detailed observations of this object will help to understand more about this ‘smoking gun’ of a gamma-ray burst.

									It is a huge honour to be part of the Jodrell Bank World Heritage Site, announced by UNESCO this week. Congratulations to Teresa Anderson (Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre) and Tim O'Brien (Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics) who led the work in preparing the bid, compiling the nomination dossier and working closely with JBO/e-MERLIN staff as well as local and national stakeholders. The inscription recognises the development of long-baseline interferometry at Jodrell Bank going back to the earliest experiments in the 1950s, which led ultimately to the MERLIN array and subsequently e-MERLIN. </p>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/pocklington.png " title="An early interferometer experiment between Jodrell Bank and a portable antenna situated near Pocklington, Yorkshire." alt="" /></a>									
									
									<p>
									Crucially, the fact that the Lovell Telescope, e-MERLIN and VLBI at Jodrell Bank continue to do world class science on the same site, is also an important part of the inscription. The inclusion of an active Observatory into the pantheon of cultural and historical sites making up the UNESCO list adds a significant scientific dimension and recognises the ongoing cultural significance of radio astronomy. It was a pleasure to host the Heritage Minister, Rebecca Pow, at Jodrell Bank for the announcement, who stressed the value of this award in maintaining this scientific and cultural contribution as well as inspiring future generations of scientists and engineers.

“If the jet were pointing towards the Earth, this would have been seen as an extremely bright and powerful gamma-ray burst.” explained Om Salafia, from the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), Italy. “No such burst has been observed at the time of the explosion, but this is not unexpected: the probability that the jet was pointing towards the Earth is very low. For these reasons, we believe that this afterglow is actually orphan”.

FIRST J1419+3940 is thus the first strong evidence that astronomers have of an orphan gamma-ray burst afterglow.
Future detailed observations of this object will help to understand more about this ‘smoking gun’ of a gamma-ray burst.

										<h2><a>Global VLBI and e-MERLIN exposes the aftermath of a violent merger of neutron stars.</a></h2>
										<br><h3>February 2019</h3><br>
										<p></p>
										<p>	In August 2017, two neutron stars were observed colliding, producing gravitational waves that were detected by the American LIGO and European VIRGO detectors.  This event is the first and only one of its type that has been observed so far, and it happened in a galaxy 130 million light years away from Earth. 
										</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									Neutron stars are ultra-dense stars, roughly the same mass as the Sun, but similar in size to a city like Manchester. Astronomers observed the event and the subsequent evolution across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma-rays and X-rays to visible light and radio waves. Two hundred days after the merger, observations combining radio telescopes in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, and North America proved the existence of a jet emerging from this violent collision.

									<p>
									These findings have been published in the scientific journal Science by an international team of astronomers, led by Giancarlo Ghirlanda from the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF, Italy).

This neutron star merger represents the first case where it was possible to associate a detection of gravitational waves to an object emitting light. The event has confirmed scientific theories that have been under discussion for decades and the association of neutron star mergers with one of the most powerful explosions in the Universe: gamma-ray bursts.  

</p><p>Dr Robert Beswick, co-author from the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, said: “This is a really exciting discovery. The team has determined that this event produced a powerful jet able to pierce through the material ejected from the neutron stars as they merged.  

“These types of observations will allow us to unveil the processes that take place during and after some of the most powerful events in the Universe.”

After the merger, a huge amount of material and energy was ejected into space, forming a shell around the object. Astronomers have been tracing its evolution at different wavelengths. However, there were still some remaining questions concerning this event that could not be clarified by any previous observations.
 "We expected part of the material to be ejected through a collimated jet, but it was unclear whether this material could successfully pierce through the surrounding shell" explains Ghirlanda. Tiziana Venturi (INAF) expanded “There were two competing scenarios: In one case, the jet cannot break through the shell, instead generating an expanding bubble around the object. In the other, the jet is successful in penetrating the shell and then propagates further into space” . Only the acquisition of very sensitive radio images with very high resolution would discard one scenario or the other. This required the use of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).

The international team conducted global observations in the direction of the merger last year using 33 radio telescopes from around the world.  Observing in tandem with this worldwide array, the UK’s e-MERLIN array, which itself comprises 6 large radio telescopes spread across the UK and operated from Jodrell Bank Observatory, joined in this campaign allowing the team to verify and confirm the interpretation of these results.

</p><p>Dr Javier Moldon, co-author from the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, added: “It is only with the extremely high resolution imaging power of the e-MERLIN, the EVN and the VLBA arrays combined that we were able to image and hence confirm the presence of a jet”.  In the coming years, many more of these neutron star binary mergers will be discovered. “The obtained results also suggest that more than 10% of all these mergers should exhibit a successful jet” explains Benito Marcote (JIVE).

										<h2><a>New images from a super-telescope bring astronomers a step closer to understanding Dark Matter.</a></h2>
										<br><h3>July 2018</h3><br>
				
										<p>
											Astronomers using a global network of radio telescopes, including the 76-m Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory,
											have produced one of the sharpest astronomical images ever. The resulting image demonstrates that dark matter is distributed
											unevenly across a distant galaxy.
										</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									The image below was created by combining data from a global radio telescope network, comprised of the European VLBI Network,
									and the Very Long Baseline Array and Green Bank Telescope in the United States, in an effort to address some of the fundamental
									questions about dark matter. The international team of astronomers aim to determine how much dark matter is present in galaxies
									and how it is distributed. According to current theories, a galaxy, such as our Milky Way, should have thousands of dwarf galaxies
									orbiting around it, yet to date only approximately 100 have been found.
									</p>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Radio_source_MG_J0751+2716.jpg" alt="" title=" Radio source MG J0751+2716 appearing as arcs due to the gravity distortion of the foreground galaxy.

</a>
									<p>
									"It has been suggested that these dwarf galaxies could be dark matter dominated and, therefore, highly difficult to observe. However, throughout the distant Universe, we can discover the presence of these small mass structures only by using the gravitational lensing effect," explains Cristiana Spingola, lead author on the paper, from The Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON) and the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute.

Gravitational lensing allows astronomers to observe incredibly distant radio sources that cannot be directly detected. By observing how the radio emission from the distant source is bent by the gravitational field of a massive object - the lens - located between the source and the Earth, it is possible to determine information about both the distant source and the lens. In this study the researchers used the radio source MG J0751+2716, at such great a distance that it has taken the light 11.7 billion years to reach the Earth. This object is comprised of a black hole with a powerful ejection of material, known as a jet. The lens consists of a group of galaxies located at a look-back time of 3.9 billion years from Earth.

In the study, the astronomers were able to determine the distance, brightness and projected size of the radio source, together with the composition of dark matter across the lens, which appeared clumpy and uneven.

"For the first time we were able to observe large gravitationally lensed arcs on extremely small angular scales. The background source - the black hole with radio jets - is distorted into these arcs on the image because of the gravitational effect of the foreground galaxies (the lens). It is a rare possibility to get such an extended arc." Spingola added, "the unprecedented detail of these extended gravitational arcs allowed us to infer with high precision the distribution of the matter of the galaxy acting as a lens."

It is only possible to obtain such high-resolution data by coordinating multiple telescopes to observe the same radio source simultaneously. In this case, 24 radio antennas from across the globe were connected using a technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Data from all the telescopes was collated in a process known as correlation, at a super computer housed at the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC in Dwingeloo, the Netherlands.

To better understand the properties for dark matter, the team are now applying sophisticated numerical algorithms to quantify the nature of the clumpy dark matter. But, they are also on the hunt for more extended gravitational arcs just like this.

"There are only a limited number of gravitational lenses suitable for this study, and while we have started this search using the European VLBI Network and the Very Long Baseline Array we expect that there will be more giant radio arcs in the future," explained John McKean, project lead from the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON) and the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute.

This study was led by John McKean from the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen and the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON), Dwingeloo on behalf of the international research team SHARP (Strong Lensing at High Angular Resolution Project) led by Chris Fassnacht (University of California, Davis), and also including Matt Auger (University of Cambridge), Leon Koopmans (University of Groningen), David Lagattuta (University of Lyon) and Simona Vegetti (Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics). Their findings can be found in Issue 4, Volume 478 of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, published by Oxford University Press.

										<h2><a>Astronomers See Distant Eruption as Black Hole Destroys Star.</a></h2>
										<br><h3>June 2018</h3><br>
										<p></p>
										<p>	For the first time, astronomers have directly imaged the formation and expansion of a fast-moving jet of material ejected when the powerful gravity of a supermassive black hole ripped apart a star that wandered too close to the massive monster.
										</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>
									The event took place in a pair of colliding galaxies called Arp 299, nearly 150 million light-years from Earth. At the core of one of the galaxies, a black hole 20 million times more massive than the Sun shredded a star more than twice the Sun's mass, setting off a chain of events that revealed important details of the violent encounter.

The scientists tracked the event with multiple radio and infrared telescopes, including the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory, working as part of the European Very Long Baseline Network (EVN).

Only a small number of such stellar deaths, called tidal disruption events, or TDEs, have ever been detected. Theorists suggested that material pulled from the doomed star forms a rotating disk around the black hole, emitting intense X-rays and visible light. It also launches jets of material outward from the poles of the disk at nearly the speed of light.

"Never before have we been able to directly observe the formation and evolution of a jet from one of these events," said Miguel Perez-Torres, of the Astrophysical Institute of Andalucia in Granada, Spain. "Tidal disruption events can provide us with a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of the formation and evolution of jets in the vicinities of these powerful objects," he added.

Dr Rob Beswick, from the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at The University of Manchester's School of Physics and Astronomy, and co-investigator of this project, said: "This is a fantastic discovery and an extremely important result in astronomy. It is a testament to the persistence of the science team and demonstrates the power of globally coordinated VLBI observations, including multiple telescopes from Jodrell Bank Observatory and the e-MERLIN array in the UK."
									</p>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Arp299_V3-NRAO-movie.gif " alt="" /></a>									
									
									<p>
									Dr. Beswick, Head of Science Operations and Support of UK's e-MERLIN/VLBI National Facility, added:
									"The discovery came as a surprise. The initial infrared burst was discovered as part of a project
									that sought to detect supernova explosions in such colliding pairs of galaxies. Arp 299 has seen
									numerous stellar explosions, and has been dubbed a 'supernova factory.' This new object originally
									was considered to be a supernova explosion."
									</p>

									<p>
									The researchers then used the Nordic Optical Telescope on the Canary Islands and NASA's Spitzer space telescope to follow the object's infrared emission. Continued observations with the EVN, VLBA and other radio telescopes, carried out over nearly a decade, showed the source of radio emission expanding in one direction at an average of one-quarter the speed of light, just as expected for a jet.
									</p>
									
									<p>
									Only in 2011, six years after discovery, the radio-emitting portion began to show an elongation. Subsequent monitoring showed the expansion growing, confirming that what the scientists are seeing is a jet, not a supernova.

These observations used multiple radio-telescope antennas, separated by thousands of miles, to gain the resolving power, or ability to see fine detail, required to detect the expansion of an object so distant. "A global network of collaborating radio antennas is the only way to see this jet structure and study the evolution of such distant objects in detail." says Eskil Varenius, formerly at Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden, now at Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics in the UK. "It is incredible what these telescope networks can do. This is a clear case where international collaboration achieve a combined whole much greater than the sum of its parts."

									<p><b>The radio telescopes of the UK's National Radio Astronomy Facility, e-MERLIN, have been directed low in the southern sky in recent weeks. Their target the aftermath of a collision between two neutron stars 124 million light years away.</b></p>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/GW170817_e-MERLIN.png" alt="" /></a>									
									
									<p>
The collision between these two super-dense remnants of exploded stars produced ripples in space-time which were detected by the LIGO gravitational wave observatory. Remarkably, other telescopes working across the spectrum from radio to gamma-rays were also able to detect the collision and its aftermath - the first time any cosmic event has been seen in both gravitational waves and by its electromagnetic radiation.

The power of e-MERLIN, working alone and in combination with the wider European VLBI Network of telescopes (EVN), is the ability to zoom in on the fine detail of these gravitational wave events and help pinpoint their precise locations. Observations with e-MERLIN began on August 23, just 6 days after the gravitational wave detection.

As Rob Beswick, Head of e-MERLIN Science Support at the University of Manchester's Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, explains, the observations of this particular event are challenging: "We are reporting today on 22 epochs of observation extending over the period from 6 to 36 days after the collision. This particular source is very low in the southern sky as seen from the UK, which means it only rises above the horizon for a few hours a day, limiting the time we can spend on it and hence making it harder to detect its very faint radio emissions.

"Even so, we are tantalisingly close to obtaining a detection. At the moment, our 1-sigma noise level is about the same as the faint transient signal detected by the Very Large Array 16 days after the outburst. Nevertheless, this places very useful stringent limits on the radio emissions over this period.

"We are continuing to obtain e-MERLIN and EVN observations. In the near future, we will also be able to include the giant Lovell Telescope in our array, greatly increasing its power. As the source evolves and potentially brightens in the coming weeks, this will make a detection far more likely."

Simon Garrington, Director of e-MERLIN and Associate Director of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, added, "This discovery is hugely exciting and will be the first of many electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources in the coming years.

"e-MERLIN is a powerful instrument capable of providing rapid and extremely sensitive radio observations of these events with high magnification imaging that rivals that of the Hubble Space Telescope. The detection of radio emissions from these gravitational wave sources is right at the limit of our current capabilities; however planned enhancements to e-MERLIN over the next few years will make future follow-ups routine.

"e-MERLIN and EVN will be crucial tools to zoom in at radio wavelengths, enabling precise (millisecond) localisation of GW events in space. Detailed localisation is likely to prove fundamental to our understanding of the energetic processes at the heart of these titanic events."</p>

Once every couple of hundred million years, the small galaxy NGC 5195 falls into the outer arms of its larger companion, NGC 5194, also known as the Whirlpool galaxy. Both galaxies are locked in a gravitational dance that will result - billions of years in the future - in the formation of a single galaxy.

As NGC 5195 plunges into the Whirlpool, matter streams onto the supermassive black hole at NGC 5195's centre and forms an accretion disc. The disc grows to a point where the supermassive black hole can no longer accrete or 'digest' efficiently and matter is blasted out into the surrounding interstellar medium. Last year, NASA's Chandra X-Ray observatory spotted arcs of X-ray emission that appeared to result from this 'force-feeding'.
